[Link to dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-03/readme.md)

Things you plan to investigate using this data set:

- Is there a certain game or group of games (every 10) that see an uptick in goals?
- Does a certain position score more power-play goals vs regular goals vs shorthand goals?
- What age group has the most xth-goal seasons (30/40/50/60, etc)?

Stat 251 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Mutating/filtering data sets
2. Creating good charts
3. Exploratory data analysis (box plots/regression etc)
4. Working with strings
